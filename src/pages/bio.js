        <p className='font-[medium] pb-16'>Darcy James Cheatle has been the frontman for some of Adelaide’s most legendary local acts of the past few years, and his solo projects are an extension of that. His first full length effort, “Smokey’s LP”, arrived in 2020, and the followup, “Smokey’s II”, saw the light of day in mid 2021, with it came the inception of the live band. Featuring guitarist Jack Larkin, bassist Anton Levings, and drummer Denzel Taylor, they provided the musical canvas for the live debut of Darcy's solo compositions, delivering performances to critical acclaim around Adelaide. </p>

        <p className='font-[medium] pb-16'>Darcy James Cheatle has been making music since early childhood, fronting projects from acoustic duo Easy Friday to powerhouse rock band SASHA. This is where Darcy cut his teeth as a front man, merging a heavy hitting funk rock with his signature surf style, and ultimately creating music which saw SASHA rise to prominence as one of the forefront bands in the Adelaide scene. Throughout this whole period, however, Darcy was writing and recording his own solo music, and it was only a matter of time before he wanted to bring this project to a stage. In 2019, Darcy released his first two solo EPs, followed by his first full length effort in 2020, “Smokey’s LP”. Following this, Darcy enlisted childhood and producer friend Samael Cole to work on the highly anticipated followup, “Smokey’s II”,which saw the light of day in mid 2021, and with it came the inception of the live band. Featuring guitarist Jack Larkin, bassist Anton Levings, and drummer Denzel Taylor, they provided the musical canvas for the live debut of Darcy’s solo compositions, delivering performances to critical acclaim around Adelaide.

        <p className='font-[medium] pb-32'>Darcy James Cheatle has been making music since early childhood, ever immersed in school ensembles and bands. At the age of 15, he and close mate Seb Reyes<span className="font-[arial]">-</span>Hewitt began performing together as the acoustic duo, Easy Friday, playing at weddings, wineries, street festivals, markets and parties right up until early 2022. Simultaneously, Darcy and Seb co<span className="font-[arial]">-</span>founded the Adelaide powerhouse rock band SASHA with Kynan Mallia and Dylan Di Palo. This is where Darcy cut his teeth as a front man, merging a heavy hitting funk rock sound with Seb and Darcy’s signature surf style, and ultimately creating music which saw SASHA rise to prominence as one of the forefront bands in the Adelaide scene. Throughout this whole period, however, Darcy was writing and recording his own solo music, and it was only a matter of time before he wanted to bring this project to a stage. In 2019, Darcy released his first two solo EPs, both recorded in true indie fashion with apple earbuds taped to an acoustic guitar. This same recording technique brought to life Darcy’s first full length effort in 2020, “Smokey’s LP”. Following this, Darcy enlisted childhood and producer friend Samael Cole to work on the highly anticipated followup, with Darcy as the sole performer, and Samael bringing to the table a much needed array of conventional recording techniques. “Smokey’s II” saw the light of day in mid 2021, and with it came the inception of the live band. Featuring guitarist Jack Larkin, bassist Anton Levings, and drummer Denzel Taylor, they provided the musical canvas for the live debut of Darcy’s solo compositions, delivering performances to critical acclaim around Adelaide.
